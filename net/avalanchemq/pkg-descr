AvalancheMQ is a message queue server, also called a message broker,
where messages are published by a sending service called a producer, via
the broker, to then be consumed by the receiving service called a
consumer. When not handling messages, the queue can route, buffer, and
persist the messages according to rules set up by the user.

Messages can be sent across languages, platforms, and OS, which decouple
processes and creates a highly scalable system. AvalancheMQ, as queue
management software, gives an organized, safe place for messages to wait
until another application or part of the system can come along and
consume them for processing.

AvalancheMQ is written in Crystal, a statically compiled LLVM-based
language with a ruby-like syntax.
